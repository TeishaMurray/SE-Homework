	<h3>A little about me</h3>
		<p id="aboutme"> I'm a Teaching Artist by trade. I teach elementary school standards using dance. I also teach aerial arts classes and Liquid Motion at a local aerial arts studio. Like most of us, I'm looking for a way to shift gears as far as my career is concerned and get more into the field of tech. I want something that provides the opportunity and upward mobility of the tech world, while still allowing for creativity.
