	<p id="bartender">I got my start at MOTR Pub which is a live music venue. Later I got trained to work their sister venue, The Woodward Theater. I love live music, so I eventually picked up a gig working at another venue, The Ludlow Garage. I had a brief stint working The View at Shire's Garden but it was a little upscale for my tastes. Still, I learned some killer Prohibition Era cocktails.</p>
